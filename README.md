# manifold-context-sim

## Overview
The `manifold-context-sim` project is designed to simulate a dynamic system using machine learning models. It provides a framework for defining models, managing memory, and simulating events based on the dynamics of the system.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd manifold-context-sim
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can use the various components of the project as follows:

1. **Model Definition**: Use `model.py` to define and train your machine learning model.
2. **Memory Management**: Utilize `memory.py` to handle data storage and retrieval during simulations.
3. **Dynamics Simulation**: Implement the system's dynamics in `dynamics.py` to describe how the state evolves over time.
4. **Training**: Run `train.py` to train your model with the provided data.
5. **Event Simulation**: Use `simulate_events.py` to simulate events based on the trained model and dynamics.

## Testing
Basic unit tests can be found in the `tests/test_basic.py` file. You can run these tests to ensure that the components of the project are functioning as expected.
